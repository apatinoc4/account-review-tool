# Nagis-tools

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository contains projects I have made to learn and apply programming concepts, using technologies such as ReactJs, Typescript, Javascript, Scss, and Mui. Below are brief descriptions of the projects currently hosted in this repository:

## Review Tool

Review Tool is an account review tool for [WAR OF THE VISIONS FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS](https://wotvffbe.com/) players. This tool evaluates the number of units, espers, vision cards, and +5 equipment that a player has based on either Krispy-Kreme or Dunkin' guild standards and exports the results in PDF format. This project was made using ReactJs, Typescript, and Mui.

## Unit Planner

Unit Planner is a tool designed for [WAR OF THE VISIONS FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS](https://wotvffbe.com/) players. The Unit Milestone Calculator helps you easily track the progress of your units and predicts when they will reach important milestones such as level 99, level 120, and level 140 based on your initial unit shards. This project was made using ReactJs, Typescript, and Scss.
