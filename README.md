# Nagi's Report Tool

This is a personal project born from the need to make a detailed, aspect by aspect , review of player accounts in the game:
[WAR OF THE VISIONS FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS](https://wotvffbe.com/)
Just type how many units, espers, vision cards and +5 equipment the player has and it will be rated by either Krispy-Kreme or DunkinÂ´ guild standards, you can also write small descriptions on what details you find relevant on each aspect and generate a PDF file with this information when done.

# Usage

You can clone this repository and run it on your machine or access [the application's website](https://www.nagis-tools.xyz/) to start reviewing.

## 1. Select the guild you will be reviewing for
